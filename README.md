Goals for Pad
======
* Secure - No accounts. No bullshit. Just a clean slate with the option to open or create a Pad. If people want to cloudify their files, they can easily stick the folder in their own Dropbox, Drive, or network disk. Pad won't force anything else onto the plate.
* Interlinkable - A core feature will be the ability to create and make clickable Wiki-like links to any number of pages within a single Pad.
* Customizable - Night and day mode. Resizable. Fullscreen mode to accommodate any usage scenario.
* Simple - Accomplishing something should take as few keystrokes and clicks as possible. No more than 2 non-standard hotkeys should need to be memorized.
* Beautiful - Visual appearance should be as clean as possible. Ideally, there should be one menu - a folder selector at the main screen, and a styling and control menu that slides down only when a page is in edit mode (not read mode). Double-click a page to go into edit mode. The window width must be 1.612x the height. The right page panel must be 1.612x the width of the lefthand page list panel.
* Quick - Animations must be fast and responsive. No longer than 300ms. The program should be able to open, ready for editing, within 1000ms.
* Readable - Notebooks must be stored simply, using a single folder wherein all text documents and media are contained. Doing so will mean that transportation and distribution will be incredibly easy. Switching between notebooks in Pad will be as easy as selecting a different folder (the user will just need to click in a single menu).
* Functional - Formatting, notebook switching, embedding, and editing must be easy to do and fully-featured.
* Collaborative - Pad needs to watch for directory changes commited by Dropbox, network users, or Google Drive and offer the chance to click "synchronize".
